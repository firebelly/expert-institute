    <p>For <em>several</em> decades, most legal actions involving cannabis were focused in the field of criminal law. However, <strong>as marijuana becomes legal for medical and recreational use</strong> in an ever-increasing number of US cities and states, as well as in Canada, other types of legal action surrounding cannabis have started to appear.</p>

    <p>As cannabis becomes a commercial product, standards for its safety, potency, and production will need to be created, assessed, and followed – and manufacturers and distributors may be held accountable for failing to meet those standards.</p>

    <p>Two recent cases, filed in Colorado and in Nova Scotia, represent the first attempts at class action product liability claims involving cannabis in their respective countries.</p>

    <h1>Understanding the Cannabis<br> Product Liability Cases</h1>

    <p><a href="#">Flores v. Livwell</a>, filed in the Denver County District Court, and <a href="#">Downton v. Organigam Holdings Inc.</a>, filed in Nova Scotia, each sought to hold their respective defendants accountable for the use of a pesticide called myclobutanil, used to treat the marijuana plants.</p>

    <p>Myclobutanil is a fungicide that is commonly used to treat food crops, including almonds, strawberries and grapes. When heated, however, myclobutanil converts into hydrogen cyanide. It has been banned in marijuana production in Canada, Colorado, Washington and Oregon, while Michigan limits its presence in cannabis products to 200 parts per billion.</p>

    <h3>Flores</h3>
    <p>In Flores, the plaintiffs sought to bring an action against Livwell Inc., a cannabis grower and dispenser. The claim alleged that Livwell had sold cannabis contaminated with Eagle 20, which contains myclobutanil.</p>

    <p>In February 2016, the court dismissed the claim, noting that the plaintiffs had not alleged or proven that they suffered an injury in fact. Their sole argument was that they suffered an economic loss by overpaying for a cannabis product that was allegedly contaminated.</p>

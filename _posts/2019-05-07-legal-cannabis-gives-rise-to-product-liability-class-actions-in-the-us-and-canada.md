<p>For several decades, most legal actions involving cannabis were focused in the field of criminal law. However, as marijuana becomes legal for medical and recreational use in an ever-increasing number of US cities and states, as well as in Canada, other types of legal action surrounding cannabis have started to appear.</p>
